#Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
These files makeup the sorting algorithm visualizer that is found in my web portfolio at [frankrossi.dev/](https://frankrossi.dev/sortingVisualizer)
Each JS file is a react component that can be imported and used in a React App
The most recent and up to date version of these files can be found within my web portfolio repo, however I will also try to update them here as changes are made!
